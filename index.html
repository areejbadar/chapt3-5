      car. Feel free to use booleans, strings, or numbers.<br />
      2. Create a variable that can hold the string value color. This variable
      containing a string value color can now be used to reference the property
      name within myCar. Then, use the variable within the square bracket
      notation to assign a new value to the color property in myCar.<br />
      3. Use that same variable and assign a new property string value to it,
      such as forSale. Use the bracket notation once again to assign a new value
      to the forSale property to indicate whether the car is available for
      purchase.<br />
      4. Output make and model into the console.<br />
